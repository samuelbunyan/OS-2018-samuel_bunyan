Amazon has spent time developing internet based technology and logistics services and in 2006 decided to expose it for the benefit of others according to Bezos, their CEO.
The founder and boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, was out speaking about the companys plans at a number of public events. Although Amazon was seen generally as an internet book retailer and then a more general internet retailer, Bezos was actually pushing three of Amazons utility computing services. These were a company that provides cheap access to online computer storage, a company that allows program developers to rent computing capacity on Amazon systems, and a service that connects firms with other firms who perform specialist tasks that are difficult to automate. The problem with online retailing, said Bezos, is its seasonality. At peak times, such as Christmas, Amazon has far more computing capacity than it needs for the rest of the year. At low points it may be using as little as 10 per cent of its total capacity. Hiring out that spare capacity is an obvious way to bring in extra revenue. In addition, Amazon soon had developed a search engine, a video download business, a service (Fulfilment By Amazon) that allowed other companies to use Amazons logistics capability including the handling of returned items, and a service that provided access to Amazons back-end technology. 
A couple of years later Amazon announced its EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service that provides resizable computing capacity in the cloud.
